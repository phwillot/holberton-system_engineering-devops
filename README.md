## Shell scripting

## This repository is containing all the shell scripts I made at Holberton School.

In order to execute the scripts, you have to follow these steps:

1. Copy the script you want to execute in a new file without extension or with the **.sh** extension.

2. Execute the following command according to your filename :
```sh
chmod u+x "filename"
```
3. Execute the script with the following command :
```sh
./"filename"
```
